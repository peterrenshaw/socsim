  desc SOCSIM: A simulation tool for social media to test against.


= Abstract

A tool to play scenario games in real time, communicating with an 
audience using twitter as a communications tool to send and receive.


= Why?

The idea behind SOCSIM is to be able to use a simple tool to test ideas 
against users in the social media sphere as a controlled experiment. 


= What it is not

This is an idea, not code... yet. A future objective might be to create a
scenario plan engine that reads plans then tweets the output, sucking up 
responses and processing results.


= Requirements

At the moment not much. A twitter account, knowledge of running a scenario
and a block of time.

= Usage

More to come.


= License

Moving towards open source.
