# Experiments

Would you like to be able to run a simple experiment using a novel scenario
to gather data to test your hypothesis?

Ceate a scenario, allow users to interact with the scenario, then collect
the results and process them. You potenially have a way to run a series 
of mini experiment asking yourself, 'what-if' type questions. Then seeing 
the results. 

Instead of a guessing, does your hypothosis match the results? Can you use
the results to improve individual or team output?


## Testing

Quantitative. 

Independent of scenario messaging is the idea of testing messages received. 
The idea is to put a number or value to a response or set of responses.

    @geehall1: There are still ways to handle the test scenario, 
    good way of evaluating skillsets for sourcing accurate, timely
    information.

Some simple things that I'd like to be able to test:

### Time 

* Q What is the time taken for any message to be posted once controller has issued a message
 
* Q What is the frequency of messages with known workload over given exercise 


### Count

Count instances of some variable to be tested. Result is an integer.

* Q: 


### Boolean

Test the truth of a variable. Results in True or False.

* Q: are resouces shown still relevant?

    @geehall1: 'some resources from 4 years ago changed or not 
    available, so updating latest resources comes into play.'

* Q: able to use URL posted?


### Sequence

Is information found to follow a given sequence of steps?
