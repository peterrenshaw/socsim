  desc SOCSIM: A simulation tool for social media to test against.


Abstract

A tool to play scenario games in real time, communicating with an 
audience using twitter as a communications tool to send and receive.


Why?

The idea behind SOCSIM is to be able to use a simple tool to test ideas 
against users in the social media sphere as a controlled experiment. 


What it is not

This is an idea, not code... yet. A future objective might be to create a
scenario plan engine that reads plans then tweets the output, sucking up 
responses and processing results.


Explained quickly

Imagine you want to see how people react with real time events on social 
media? Do you wait for a real event to happen to see what the response is? You 
could do this. What about creating an exercise that participants join in on
and contribute in real time to solve a puzzle or problem?

How this might work:

* A controller, a person or group of people decide to create a scenario to 
  test an idea. A time limit is set and the bounds of the idea to explore are noted.

* Participants are notified of a name, a time a URL to follow and specific instructions
  to highlight this exercise. 

* Participants are then given an objective and some some upfront information on 
  the twitter channel. It is up to them to respond according to what they think is 
  appropriate response by tweeting the info back to the controller.

* As the scenario moves along, subtle or random information to further test 
  responses.

* The controller then ends the exercise, extracts the information from the twitter replies.

* The information is analysed depending on the original experiment.

* The results published.


Applications

To be updated.


Requirements

At the moment not much. A twitter account, knowledge of running a scenario
and a block of time.


Key words:

* scenario
- a fictional or non fictional series of events and responses over a set 
  period of time. 

* controller
- Person or persons who set-up the scenario, then run the experiment on users.

* users
- operators of social media accoutns that you want to test against.

* time
- a period of time a scenario is run.
- best be short
- 5, 10, 15, 30 minute intervals

* fog
- things that you can't see or imagine that influence the scenario, users and/or controllers

* analysis
- the results you get back can be analysed to see if your original idea is valid or can be improved 
  on.


Usage

More to come.
